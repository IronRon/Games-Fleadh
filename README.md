# Description of the project
In Random Access Runner, you are thrust into the digital labyrinth of your own computer after a malicious virus launches a sophisticated attack. As the system's last hope, you must navigate through intricately procedurally generated maps that represent the inner workings of your computer. Each level is a complex terminal that holds part of the solution to eradicate the virus and restore system integrity.

The stakes are high, as each decision affects the health of your system. With a dynamic and ever-changing environment, no two playthroughs are the same, offering endless replayability. Race against time, restore all the terminals, and reclaim your system from the brink of digital chaos in Random Access Runner — where every byte counts!

# Instructions for use
Download the zip file from releases. Unzip the folder. Run extraced .exe file

# How it works:

Players begin by selecting 'New Game' from the main menu. The game initializes by generating a unique digital maze that represents the player’s computer system compromised by a virus.

Each level in the game is procedurally generated. This means that the layout, locations of terminals, enemy spawn points, and power-ups are generated algorithmically, ensuring that no two playthroughs are the same.
The complexity and size of the mazes changes depending on the difficulty of the game.

The primary objective in each level is to restore all compromised terminals. Players must navigate the maze, find each terminal, and restore it.
Secondary objectives include collecting orbs for upgrades, enhancing the player's abilities, and helps the traverse the levels.
